<!-- How filter Works:

The filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
The function checks if the current index of the element (index) is different from the index of the first occurrence of that element (self.indexOf(val)).


Step-by-Step Execution:
Value: 1, Index: 0

self.indexOf(1) returns 0 (first occurrence of 1 is at index 0).
index is 0.
self.indexOf(1) !== 0 is false.
1 is not included in result.
Value: 2, Index: 1

self.indexOf(2) returns 1 (first occurrence of 2 is at index 1).
index is 1.
self.indexOf(2) !== 1 is false.
2 is not included in result.
Value: 2, Index: 2

self.indexOf(2) returns 1 (first occurrence of 2 is at index 1).
index is 2.
self.indexOf(2) !== 2 is true.
2 is included in result.
Value: 3, Index: 3

self.indexOf(3) returns 3 (first occurrence of 3 is at index 3).
index is 3.
self.indexOf(3) !== 3 is false.
3 is not included in result.
Value: 4, Index: 4

self.indexOf(4) returns 4 (first occurrence of 4 is at index 4).
index is 4.
self.indexOf(4) !== 4 is false.
4 is not included in result.
Value: 4, Index: 5

self.indexOf(4) returns 4 (first occurrence of 4 is at index 4).
index is 5.
self.indexOf(4) !== 5 is true.
4 is included in result.
Value: 5, Index: 6

self.indexOf(5) returns 6 (first occurrence of 5 is at index 6).
index is 6.
self.indexOf(5) !== 6 is false.
5 is not included in result.
Value: 7, Index: 7

self.indexOf(7) returns 7 (first occurrence of 7 is at index 7).
index is 7.
self.indexOf(7) !== 7 is false.
7 is not included in result.
Value: 7, Index: 8

self.indexOf(7) returns 7 (first occurrence of 7 is at index 7).
index is 8.
self.indexOf(7) !== 8 is true.
7 is included in result.
Value: 1, Index: 9

self.indexOf(1) returns 0 (first occurrence of 1 is at index 0).
index is 9.
self.indexOf(1) !== 9 is true.
1 is included in result.

Summary:
The result array contains elements that have duplicates in the original array.
The order of elements in result is based on their first duplicate occurrence in the original array.
1 appears last in result because its duplicate occurrence is at the last index (9) in the original array. -->
